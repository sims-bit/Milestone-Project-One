#### Surface 
Aesthetically for the site I decided that a minimalist feel would be most appropriate for the artists portfolio. Wanting it to have a sleek and clean design, I wanted a simple floating navigation bar as well as opting for the artists name- Daniel Harman, to serve as the link to the landing page. 
It was essential that high quality images that were not warped and are of an adequate size to depict the details within the work were used for the site. 
I utilized Colorhunt.co to find a colour palette for the site, wanting the site to have a  warming aesthetic whilst requiring a neutrality so as not to take away from the images of the artists work.

#### Bugs and Fixes
A issue that I encountered was  the renaming of my files in keeping with industry standard.  Requiring a change in my git config settings to stop being case insensitive as it was preventing the renaming of the files.
In running the site code through the validator, it illustrated several issues with my code. Mainly being the issues with regards to my file paths, from the use of invalid characters. I was able to fix this and restore the images to the code. I unfortunately found several floating <div> tags within the code, I was able to locate and fix.

Another bug that I encountered was the body container hugging the left of the screen on the index page and the project-three-page. I was able to find that on the index page I had implemented the container class in the wrong tag and on project-three-page I had not included the container class which would fix the layout issue to centralise the page body.
